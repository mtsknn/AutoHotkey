# [`special_characters.ahk`](./special_characters.ahk)

**Provides [hotstrings][] to easily type special characters.**

[hotstrings]: https://lexikos.github.io/v2/docs/Hotstrings.htm

My favorite script!
Makes life so much easier.

## Finnish alphabet (ä, Ä, ö, Ö)

These four hotstrings are the most important for me:

- When I type `h'`, the characters get replaced with ä.
- When I type `H'`, the characters get replaced with Ä.
- When I type `h;`, the characters get replaced with ö.
- When I type `H;`, the characters get replaced with Ö.

Before I created this script,
I was constantly toggling the input language
between US English and Finnish
with <kbd>Win</kbd> + <kbd>Space</kbd>.
I switched to Finnish when I was writing Finnish (my native language)
and otherwise kept US English active.

But man, it was _so annoying_
to forget many times a day which one is the currently active input language.
It was also unergonomic to constantly toggle between the two.

No more!
Now I can keep US English active all the time
while still being able to write Finnish comfortably.

I have tried many different hotstrings for typing ä's and ö's,
but the above hostrings seem to be the most ergonomic and comfortable for me.
There are a few apps and situations
where the hotstrings don't work reliably,
but they work like 95% of the time,
and that's enough for me.

## Other special characters

Below are the next five hotstrings
that I use the most.
The "HTML entity" column
is just for reference.

| Type this | Get this | HTML entity | Comments                       |
| --------- | -------- | ----------- | ------------------------------ |
| `;b`      | •        | `&bull;`    | Bullet; great for bullet lists |
| `;nb`     |          | `&nbsp;`    | Non-breaking space             |
| `;nd`     | –        | `&ndash;`   | En dash                        |
| `;ra`     | →        | `&rarr;`    | Right arrow                    |
| `;x`      | ×        | `&times;`   | Multiplication sign            |

And here are the rest of the hotstrings
provided by the script.
I use these only rarely,
but they are nice to have around.

## What about emojis?

Creating hotstrings for emojis would be very possible,
but I haven't because
I find the default emoji picker in Windows 10 good enough:
press <kbd>Win</kbd> + <kbd>.</kbd> (period)
or <kbd>Win</kbd> + <kbd>;</kbd>
and start typing an emoji's name.
